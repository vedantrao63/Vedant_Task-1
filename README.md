# Prediction using Suprevised ML
In this project, We predict the percentage of a student based on the numbers of study hours. This DataSet contain two variables. We solve This task by using simple regression.

## Importng all required libraries
```bash
    import pandas as pd
    import numpy as np
    mport matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    %matplotlib inline
```
### For LinearRegression
```bash
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

    from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
```
using pandas and matplotlib for data cleaning and analyzing data.

Apply Linear Regression model to train and predict our OUTCOME.
